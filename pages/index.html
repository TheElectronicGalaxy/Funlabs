                    Doing and learning math is one of my most favorite pastimes. While math is very useful and practicable in certain scenarios I like to view math as an art, and when I do math I like to imagine myself as an artist or an author crafting a storyline looking for a clue or a hint that will connect all the dots together to craft a wonderful solution to an otherwise diffuclt problem. This is a very common take to all hobbies in general but math tends to get left behind because of it's abstraction and unapproachability and I hope to get more people interested in math by showing how beautiful it can be when approached just the right way. As of now, I'm concentrating on olympiad mathematics and also getting good at higher level mathematics

                    I also really like physics in that you can literally derive the entirety of modern physics in a few couple of hours just using some standard lemmas, logic and nothing more. It's a true reflection of modern human ingenuity in my opinion. I was actually so deep into the physics train I finished 75% of the khan academy physics course in a year, that wasn't that healthy in hindsight but the joy that I felt while learning it was even greater than that of maths. I've tried designing a couple of contraptions in the past 3 years but all of them have stayed purely in the theoretical side mostly because of how impractical they were. I hope to build more projects soon and upload them here
